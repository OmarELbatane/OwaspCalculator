# OWASP Risk Rating Calculator

This project is an implementation of the OWASP Risk Rating methodology. It's a tool designed to assess cybersecurity risks, taking into account various factors and categorizing them into sections like Threat Agent Factors, Vulnerability Factors, Technical Impact Factors, and Business Impact Factors.

## Description

The OWASP Risk Rating Calculator helps in evaluating the security risks in software or web applications. The assessment is based on different criteria across four main categories:

1. **Threat Agent Factors:** This considers the skill level and motive of the threat agent, among other factors.
2. **Vulnerability Factors:** This involves the ease of discovery and exploit of vulnerabilities.
3. **Technical Impact Factors:** This assesses the impact on confidentiality, integrity, availability, and accountability.
4. **Business Impact Factors:** This considers the financial, reputation, compliance, and privacy implications.

Each factor has various options with assigned scores to quantify the risk levels.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Tkinter library for Python (usually comes with Python).
- Matplotlib library for plotting the risk assessment graph.

### Installing

- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
- Install any missing dependencies.

### Executing Program

- Run the program using Python.
- Interact with the GUI to select different risk factors.
- Evaluate to see the risk assessment graph.
